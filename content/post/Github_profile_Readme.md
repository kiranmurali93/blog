## Step 1

![New Repo Option](../../static/images/create_repo.png?raw=true "New Repo")

>Name the repository Note: The name of the repo should be same as your user name, since I have already created it before making this I have a error showing that repository already exist

![New Repo Option](../../static/images/repo_name.png?raw=true "Name Repo")

>When you create the repository, you see a notification that you are creating a special repository and that the README.md file of that repository will be shown in your profile.

> Initialise with Readme.md when you are creating your repository.

>Once you have your repository created, go check you profile page and you can see that the readme file is displayed on top of your pinned repositories.

>Edit your Readme.md file and add some cool stuff
